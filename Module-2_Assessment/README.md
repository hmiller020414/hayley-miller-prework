## Usage

Open the index.html file in your browser of choice to launch the game. 

Pressing any letter will automatically start the game by generating a random word. Words come from one of three categories: Phrases, Places or Things. 

The letters R, S, T, L, N and E will automatically appear in your puzzle for you, if they exist.

You will have 5 incorrect guesses to correctly fill in the missing blanks and solve the puzzle. You will see how many guesses remain, the letters you've incorrectly guessed and your win count beneath the puzzle.

After completing — or failing to complete — a puzzle, press any key to generate a new one!
