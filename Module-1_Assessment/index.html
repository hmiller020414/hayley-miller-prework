                        <p>Thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Hayley Miller and I’m thrilled to share some of my projects with you. I’m a 23 year old graduate from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism. In an introductory class that every journalism student must take, we used CodeAcademy to learn a very basic amount of HTML and CSS. It was my favorite unit, and a sign I should have used my math and science skills to pursue computer science all along. Better late than never, right?
                        </p>

                    <p>I am the oldest of four children, and I have three younger brothers. Two of them are identical twins, both minoring in computer science. Their advice and help has been invaluable in helping me pursue my passion. My significant other is also a software developer, and I have to thank him for being supportive as I start from square one. My younger brother is a decade younger than I am, and likes Lego, Star Wars, Harry Potter, baking and acting.

                    <p>During quarantine, outside of learning to code through this course, Free Code Camp and Harvard’s introductory course CS50 online, I have been learning new things and reading and puzzling a lot. I downloaded the Duolingo app to learn Chinese, and have been loving it. After years of trying, I’ve finally “mastered” juggling and took up book blogging.</p>
